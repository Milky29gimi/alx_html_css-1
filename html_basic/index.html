            Ethiopia,officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 
        is a landlocked country located in the Horn of Africa region of East Africa. 
        It shares borders with Eritrea to the north, Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia 
        to the east and southeast, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west, and Sudan to the northwest.
        Ethiopia covers a land area of 1,112,000 square kilometres (472,000 sq. miles).
        As of 2023, it is home to around 126.5 million inhabitants, making it the 13th-most populous country in the world, 
        the 2nd-most populous in Africa after Nigeria, and the most populated landlocked country on Earth.
        The national capital and largest city, Addis Ababa, lies several kilometres west of the 
        East African Rift that splits the country into the African and Somali tectonic plates.

        <h2> Ethiopians </h2>
        <p>
            Ethiopians are the native inhabitants of Ethiopia, as well as the global 
            diaspora of Ethiopia. Ethiopians constitute several component ethnic groups, 
            many of which are closely related to ethnic groups in neighboring Eritrea and 
            other parts of the Horn of Africa.  
        </p>
        <h3> Culture of Ethiopia </h3>
        <p>
            The culture of Ethiopia is diverse and generally structured along ethnolinguistic lines. 
            The country's Oromo-speaking majority adhere to an amalgamation of traditions that were 
            developed independently and through interaction with neighboring and far away civilizations, 
            including other parts of Kenya, Sudan, Egypt, and other parts in East Africa. By contrast, 
            the nation's Nilotic communities and other ethnolinguistic minorities tend to practice customs 
            more closely linked with South Sudan and/or the African Great Lakes region
        </p>
        <p>
            The Ethiopian cuisine consists of various vegetable or meat side dishes and entrees, 
            often prepared as a wat or thick stew. One or more servings of wat are placed upon a piece of injera, 
            a large sourdough flatbread, which is 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour. 
            One does not eat with utensils, but instead uses injera (always with the right hand) to scoop up the 
            entrees and side dishes. Traditional Ethiopian food does not use any pork or seafood (aside from fish), 
            as most Ethiopians have historically adhered to Islam, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, or Judaism, 
            all of which prohibit eating pork and shellfish. Additionally, throughout a given year, Orthodox Christians 
            observe numerous fasts (such as Lent), during which food is prepared without any meat or dairy products. 
            Another dish served in Ethiopia is Doro wat, which is chicken stew with hard boiled eggs.
